# Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization and Demand Forecasting

### A Capstone Project by RAJ SHEKHAR

## 1\. Introduction & Problem Statement

This project presents an end-to-end data science solution for a major retail organization facing challenges in operational efficiency and revenue optimization. The core problem is the inability to systematically analyze complex sales data, leading to inaccurate demand forecasts, suboptimal inventory levels, and ineffective marketing campaigns.

This framework leverages advanced machine learning and statistical analysis to transform raw data into actionable intelligence. By building highly accurate forecasting models, segmenting stores based on performance, and detecting sales anomalies, this project provides a proactive, data-driven strategy to optimize inventory, personalize marketing, and enhance overall store performance.

## 2\. Dataset

The analysis is based on three distinct datasets:

  * **Sales Data:** Contains weekly sales figures for each store and department combination over a period of \~2.5 years.
  * **Store Data:** Contains metadata, including the `Type` and `Size`, for each of the 45 stores.
  * **Features Data:** Contains external factors for each store and week, including promotional `MarkDown` data, `Temperature`, `Fuel_Price`, `CPI`, and `Unemployment` rates.

## 3\. Project Workflow

The project followed a structured, end-to-end data science pipeline:

1.  **Data Cleaning & Wrangling:** Merged the three datasets and handled missing values by interpreting their business context (e.g., imputing `NaN` in `MarkDown` columns with 0).
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed extensive visualization (over 15 charts) to uncover key patterns related to seasonality, store performance, holiday impacts, and feature correlations.
3.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistically validated key insights from the EDA using t-tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlation tests.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Created a rich set of features for modeling, including sales lags, rolling averages, and cyclical time-based features (sine/cosine).
5.  **Model Implementation & Tuning:** Developed and compared three distinct regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Ridge Regression). Models were tuned using time-series-aware cross-validation (`TimeSeriesSplit`).
6.  **Advanced Analysis:**
      * **Store Segmentation:** Implemented K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group stores into data-driven segments.
      * **Anomaly Detection:** Used time-series decomposition to identify unusual sales weeks.
7.  **Conclusion & Strategy Formulation:** Synthesized all analytical findings into a comprehensive report with actionable business recommendations.

## 4\. Key Insights & Findings

  * **Dominant Seasonality:** Sales are heavily driven by a predictable seasonal cycle, with massive peaks during the **Thanksgiving (Week 47)** and **Christmas (Week 52)** holidays.
  * **Performance Hierarchy:** Store performance is strongly correlated with its `Type` and `Size`. Type 'A' stores are the largest and highest-grossing, followed by Type 'B' and then 'C'.
  * **Recent Performance is Key:** The single most important predictor of a store's future weekly sales is its sales from the previous week (`Weekly_Sales_Lag1`), which had an importance of over 85% in the final model.

## 5\. Modeling and Performance

The **Tuned Random Forest Regressor** was selected as the final prediction model due to its superior performance on the unseen test data.

  * **Final Model R-squared (RÂ²): 0.9609**
      * This indicates that the model successfully explains over **96%** of the variability in weekly sales, making it a highly accurate and reliable forecasting tool.

## 6\. Strategic Recommendations

The analysis resulted in a set of data-driven strategic recommendations:

  * **Inventory Management:** Implement the forecasting model to automate short-term inventory replenishment and proactively increase stock for key departments during identified seasonal peaks.
  * **Personalized Marketing:** Move away from a one-size-fits-all approach by using the store segments to create tailored marketing campaigns that resonate with the specific characteristics of each store cluster.
  * **Store Optimization:** Replicate the "best practices" of top-performing stores within each segment to lift the performance of underachievers. Prioritize future expansion based on the profiles of the most profitable store segments.

## 7\. Tech Stack

  * **Language:** Python
  * **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, XGBoost, Plotly, SHAP, SciPy

## 8\. How to Run

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required libraries. It is recommended to create a `requirements.txt` file and run:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Place the three dataset files (`sales data-set.csv`, `stores data-set.csv`, `Features data set.csv`) in the root directory.
4.  Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `Retail Store Analytics.ipynb`.
